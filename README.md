# Emblem Knight — and the Alchemical Dragon

A *Dragon Warrior*–style RPG **and roguelike** whose entire art set is built from
the Emblem Print Shop's extracted alchemical engravings, themed on Michael Maier's
*Atalanta Fugiens* (1617). An isometric, NES/SNES-era overworld hub; a first-person,
command-menu battle screen where every monster is a woodcut creature from a real
emblem plate; and a procedurally-generated, fog-of-war **descent through the four
stages of the Great Work** with permadeath.

> Choose your vessel — Knight, Alchemist, Atalanta, or Hippomenes — in the world
> above. Meet the King, then descend the eastern stair into the Opus: twelve
> procedurally-built floors that pass through **Nigredo → Albedo → Citrinitas →
> Rubedo**, each announced with a genuine Maier motto, until the **Alchemical
> Dragon** is slain and the Philosopher's Stone is won. Die and the save is gone.

### The Atalanta Fugiens framing

The story is grounded in the project's own alchemy databases (`C:\Dev\Claudiens`,
`C:\Dev\ALCHEMYTIMELINEMAP`, `C:\Dev\TheosophicalAlchemyDB`):

- The **four colour stages** of the *magnum opus* structure the descent, each with
  a real motto, e.g. Albedo's *"Go to the woman who washes the sheets, and do as
  she does"* (Emblem III) and Rubedo's *"Make a circle of man and woman… and thou
  shalt have the Stone"* (Emblem XXI).
- **Atalanta** = the volatile/Mercury (the fleeing principle), **Hippomenes** =
  the fixed/Sulphur (the pursuer), and the **three golden apples** are her trick —
  in-game the *Golden Apple* item lets you flee any battle, even the boss.
- The goal is the **Lapis / Philosopher's Stone**; *festina lente* ("make haste
  slowly") is the recurring watchword.

## Play it

**[Play online →](https://t3dy.github.io/EmblemRoguelike/)** (GitHub Pages)

## Run it locally

A static server is registered in `.claude/launch.json` as **emblem-knight**
(serves this `game/` folder on port 7431):

```
python game/tools/serve_nocache.py    # serves game/ on :7431 with no-cache headers
# then open http://localhost:7431/
```

(Plain `python -m http.server 7431 --directory game` also works; the no-cache
server just avoids stale ES modules during development.) ES modules require
http(s) — opening `index.html` from `file://` will not load.

## Controls

| Action               | Keys                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Move (overworld)     | Arrow keys / WASD (held)      |
| Move (dungeon, turn) | Arrow keys / WASD (per press) |
| Choose character     | ← → then Z                    |
| Confirm / talk       | Z / Space / Enter             |
| Cancel / save / back | X / Esc / Backspace           |
| Music on/off         | M                             |
| (Touch)              | On-screen D-pad + A/B buttons |

Movement is screen-aligned: ▲ walks "up" the isometric grid, etc. The overworld
moves smoothly; the dungeon is **turn-based** (one tile per press; enemies act
after you do).

GAME OVER ◀──hero HP 0 (permadeath, save wiped)──────────── Dragon slain ─▶ VICTORY (the Stone)
```

- **Character select** (`_renderCharSelect` in `js/main.js`): pick one of four
  emblem-drawn vessels; each re-skins the hero and tweaks stats / kit / a passive.
- **Overworld** (`js/world.js`): isometric diamond-tile renderer (64×32 tiles), the
  safe hub — Sun-Castle (quest + Golden Apples), Town (free rest), wild encounters,
  and the eastern stair into the Opus.
- **The Opus** (`js/dungeon.js`): procedurally-generated floors (rooms + corridors),
  isometric walls, **fog of war**, turn-based movement, enemies that wander and
  chase (contact → battle), floor loot, stairs down. Floor depth → colour-stage
  theming (palette + monster pool + enemy stat-scaling) + a real Maier motto. The
  Dragon waits on floor 12; beating it wins the Stone. **Permadeath**: a battle
  lost anywhere wipes the save; the title tracks your deepest descent.
- **Quests** (`QUESTS` in `js/data.js`): the **King (Sol)** and **Queen (Luna)**
  set *charges* — random "calls to action," each quoting a genuine *Atalanta
  Fugiens* motto plus a recited **emblem-poem couplet**. They appear two ways:
  - In the **overworld court**: the King at his castle, the **Queen at her bower**
    (the `Q` tile beside the castle) — visit before a run to stock charges.
  - In the **Opus**: a King or Queen may hold court on a random floor (~55%).

  Charges set an objective (slay N of a creature, gather relics/gold, descend N
  floors, reach a stage) and pay out gold / items / EXP / +max HP. Active charges
  show in the dungeon HUD; the givers are the `q_king` / `q_queen` emblem figures.
  Sol's charges lean martial (fire, slaying, descent, the Stone); Luna's lean lunar
  (washing, gathering, the woman, flight).
- **The Great Work questline** (`OPUS_LINE`): a 4-step chain the royals offer **in
  order**, one per colour stage — *Nigredo* (slay the blackness) → *Albedo* (wash
  the matter) → *Citrinitas* (raise the Lion) → *Rubedo* (reach the red and face
  the Dragon). Each step quotes its emblem; finishing the chain bestows **the
  Crown** (+5 atk, +4 def) and points you at the Dragon. Tracked via `hero.opusStep`.
- **Battle** (`js/battle.js`): turn-based FIGHT / SPELL / ITEM / RUN. Damage =
  `max(1, atk − def/2) × rand(0.8–1.2)` with 7% crits. Enemies may breathe fire.
  Win → EXP + gold + automatic level-ups (HP/MP/atk/def grow, spells learned).
- **Persistence**: hero state saved to `localStorage` after battles, town rests,
  and on the cancel/save key. The title shows **Continue** when a save exists.
- **Audio**: procedural WebAudio blips (no sound files) for hits, magic, heals,
  encounters, level-ups, victory and defeat.
- **Music** (`js/music.js`): **Michael Maier's actual Atalanta Fugiens fugues
  (1617)**, played the way he wrote them. Each emblem is a three-voice canon —
  *Atalanta* (vox fugiens), *Hippomenes* (vox sequens), and *Pomum objectum* (vox
  morans, the cantus firmus). The note data lives in `assets/fugues.json`: every
  fugue as `{bpm, beats, notes:[[startBeat, durBeat, midi], …]}` with all three
  voices written out. The engine schedules each note via WebAudio (lower voices on
  a rounder sine, upper voices on triangle) — no audio files. Fugues are grouped
  into per-area playlists **by their colour-stage in the Work** and cycle (next
  fugue when one ends): e.g. Nigredo plays the ouroboros-dragon fugue (emblem 14),
  Rubedo the Philosopher's-Stone fugue (emblem 21), battle the Dragon fugues
  (25/19/50/44). **M** toggles music.

  *Provenance:* the pitches/rhythms are Maier's public-domain 1617 canons. They
  were parsed from a MIDI sequencing of all 50 fugues by `tools/build_fugues.py`;
  the authoritative MEI transcription of Fugue 1 (Brown University's *Furnace &
  Fugue*) was used to confirm the three-voice structure. Re-run `build_fugues.py`
  to regenerate `fugues.json` from the MIDIs in `_curation/midi/`.

## Characters (choose your vessel)

Defined in `CLASSES` (`js/data.js`); each is a real human figure from the emblems.

| Class       | Sprite (source)                    | Playstyle / passive                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Knight      | `hero` (Stolcius 13)               | Balanced; *Stout* +10% max HP                     |
| Alchemist   | `c_alchemist` (Atalanta Emblem XXI)| Frail caster; starts with Heal+Blaze, +MP/level  |
| Atalanta    | `c_atalanta` (Stolcius 2)          | Volatile; **always** flees, extra Golden Apples  |
| Hippomenes  | `c_hippomenes` (Splendor Solis)    | Aggressive; *Pursuer* +15% attack damage         |

## The descent — stages of the Great Work

`STAGES` (`js/data.js`) maps floor depth to the four colour stages; each sets the
palette, the enemy pool, and a genuine *Atalanta Fugiens* motto shown on entry.

| Floors | Stage      | Motto (Maier)                                              |
|--------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–3    | Nigredo    | "Putrefaction is the beginning of generation."            |
| 4–6    | Albedo     | "Go to the woman who washes the sheets, and do as she does." |
| 7–9    | Citrinitas | "Nature teaches Nature; Nature conquers Nature."          |
| 10–12  | Rubedo     | "Make a circle of man and woman… and thou shalt have the Stone." |

Floor 12 (Rubedo) holds the **Dragon**; defeat it to achieve the **Lapis**.

### Items

`herb` (heal), `potion`/Aqua Vitae (MP), `elixir`/Red Elixir (full restore),
**`apple`/Golden Apple** (flee any battle, even bosses — Atalanta's trick), plus
floor-only finds: gold piles and *Philosophic Salt* (+4 max HP).

## Landmarks & progression

| Tile           | Sprite                    | Effect                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Castle         | `s_castle`                | King gives the quest + 30 gold (first visit) |
| Town           | `s_town`                  | Full HP/MP rest                              |
| Dungeon        | `s_door`                  | Entrance to the Opus (the roguelike descent) |
| Forest / Woods | `t_forest` / `t_forest2`  | Tier-2 encounters (bears, stags, boars…)     |
| Cliff          | `t_cliff`                 | Tier-2 encounters (harpies, stags)           |
| Badlands       | —  (reddish ground)       | Tier-3 encounters (lions, wyrms, ouroboros)  |
| Cave           | `t_cave`                  | Tier-3 encounters; gateway terrain to dungeon|
| Mountain/Peaks | `t_mountain`/`t_mountain2`| Impassable                                   |
| Water          | —                         | Impassable                                   |

The continent runs west→east in difficulty: home **Sun-Castle** and gentle grass
in the west, **Town** (free rest) in the centre, then the eastern **badlands**,
caves and cliffs — tier-3 country — funnelling to the **Dungeon** in the far east.

Encounter pools by region live in `js/data.js` (`REGION_POOLS`). The monster
roster, stats, spells, items and the level curve are all data-driven there.

## Assets — from emblem to sprite

35 curated extractions become game sprites via `tools/build_assets.py`:

1. optional manual crop — many creatures live *inside* a full plate, so dragons
   are cut straight from the Atalanta Fugiens engravings (emblem-25 coiled dragon,
   emblem-14 ouroboros, emblem-50 coiling wyrm; the boar from emblem-41),
2. paper/background removal (bright engraving paper → transparent),
3. alpha-bbox crop + resize (nearest/Lanczos) for an NES-ish read,
4. light 4-bit posterize.

Output goes to `assets/sprites/*.png` plus `assets/manifest.json` (consumed at
runtime by `js/assets.js`). To re-curate or swap art, edit the `MANIFEST` list in
`tools/build_assets.py` and re-run it.

> Note on labels: GroundingDINO's extraction vocabulary had no "lion", so lions
> are filed under `dog`/`bear` in the catalog (e.g. the in-game Lion and Winged
> Lion are both `dog`-tagged Stolcius plates). Dragons are mostly only findable by
> hand-cropping the source plates — the `dragon`-tagged catalog records are largely
> mislabelled full pages.

## Prototype scope / next steps

Playable end-to-end: title → explore → fight → level → boss → victory/defeat.
Natural extensions: directional hero sprites, a shop economy with the gold,
inn cost, more map regions, status effects, a small story beyond the single quest,
and battle sprite-entry animations.
